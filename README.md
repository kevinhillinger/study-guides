## About Me

I am a Principal Cloud Solutions Architect for Microsoft and have  16 years of experience designing and contstructing applications and distributed systems. 

I've have contributed code to the Azure Functions service. I'm also a Certified Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect (I have taken all exams I've created study guides for cold and successfully passed so I'm not just blowing smoke here). 

I'm passionate about building systems and telling a story through code so that others can gain meaningful understanding of it's intent, ultimately making it stable and maintainable.
