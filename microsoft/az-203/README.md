## About This Guide
I'm not going to focus on things like exam structure, pricing, yada yada. You can easily find this information with a search or directly on the Microsoft learning site. What I'll focus on is the resources that target the topics covered by the exam, and my opinion on what you should be focusing on during the course of your study time.

## Considerations Before You Begin Studying
This exam is meant to be take by a practitioner. You most likely need at least one (1) year of experience in development. Do you need to know everything? No, you don't.

## Have a programming language under your belt
The exam is almost entirely in C#, so having a working knowledge of Azure SDKs is going to be a prerquisite to passing the exam. If you know other languages, that's great and it should translate to being able to answer the questions since you'll understand general rules for imperative and/or functional programming.

If you don't or have never written code, the exam is going to be a big challenge for you.
