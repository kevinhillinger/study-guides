# Exam CKAD: Kubernetes Certified Application Developer

## Getting Started

### 1. Familiarize yourself with the cirriculum
Understand that the questions on the exam will correspond to the [cirriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum). Pay attention to the areas where a high percentage is placed.

Watch [Everything You Need to Know About the CKA and CKAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFGPArjYMbQ) and try and "read between the lines" about the content of the exam. Because no one can say exactly what's on the test, nothing can be called out directly, but it's still useful to listen to an official guide on the exam.

### 2. Foundational Kubernetes knowledge
If you already use Kubernetes, you can skip this portion. Here's my suggested material to go through (in order).

1. [Intro to Kubernetes (edX)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes) - You'll be introduced to core concepts so you can build on this knowledge

2. [Intro to Kubernetes (Katacoda interactive)](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes) - Go through each scenario.

3. [Scalable Microservices With Kubernetes (Google)](https://eu.udacity.com/course/scalable-microservices-with-kubernetes--ud615)
    > _A note on Kubernetes The Hard Way_: there are a few resources that you may find via an internet search that suggest you go through [*Kubernetes The Hard Way*](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) for CKAD. While this is an excellent learning exercise, it's not needed for CKAD. If you plan on taking CKA, then yes, allocate time to do it for CKA.

4. [What The Hack - Kubernetes By Example (Microsoft)](https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/blob/master/001-IntroToKubernetes) - Here, you'll get the chance to actually deploy a sample application. It uses Microsoft Cloud's [AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough).
