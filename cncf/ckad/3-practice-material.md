# Exam CKAD: Kubernetes Certified Application Developer

## Practice Material
The exam is about doing. I loved it.

1. [CKAD Exercises](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises) - Do these until you can solve the answers in your sleep

2. [Kubernetes by example](http://kubernetesbyexample.com/) - By going through these exercises, you'll become familiar with all different types you'll be working with via `kubectl`.

3. [AKS Workshop (Kubernetes on Microsoft Cloud)](https://aksworkshop.io/) - Going through this free workshop, you'll deploy a "full stack" multi-container application, so this is really useful.
