# Exam CKAD: Kubernetes Certified Application Developer

## Practice Material
The exam is about doing. I loved it. With that, you must be good at doing :)

Here are two strategies you must do to become a proficient practitioner of kubernetes for application development:

1. Time yourself - Take each section of the exercises and iterate over it, timing yourself. Stop your watch and mark your time. Start shaving time down each day until you feel like you're consistently doing it at a speed that you feel is acceptable.

2. Memorize - You must be able to get through all exercises from memory (quickly, so time yourself) the first time. This means, hard work. Practice, practice, then practice some more. Create a kata for each area of the curriculum, performing each task until you can do it from memory.

### 1. [CKAD Exercises](https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises) 
Do these until you can solve the answers in your sleep. It's that simple. 

### 2. [Kubernetes by example](http://kubernetesbyexample.com/) 
By going through these exercises, you'll become familiar with all different types you'll be working with via `kubectl`.

### 3. [AKS Workshop (Kubernetes on Microsoft Cloud)](https://aksworkshop.io/)
Going through this free workshop, you'll deploy a "full stack" multi-container application, so this is really useful.
