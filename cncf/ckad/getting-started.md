# Exam CKAD: Kubernetes Certified Application Developer

## Getting Started

### 1. Familiarize yourself with the cirriculum
Understand that the questions on the exam will correspond to the [cirriculum](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum). Pay attention to the areas where a high percentage is placed.

### 2. Gain proficiency with the tooling
You won't be able to take the test and pass if you don't know how to use a *nix terminal and Vim. 

Go to: [study guide for essential bash and vim](essential-bash-vim.sh).

### 3. Have basic Kubernetes knowledge
If you already use Kubernetes, you can skip this portion. Here's my suggested material to go through (in order).

1. [Intro to Kubernetes (edX)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-kubernetes) - You'll be introduced to core concepts so you can build on this knowledge

2. [Scalable Microservices With Kubernetes (Google)](https://eu.udacity.com/course/scalable-microservices-with-kubernetes--ud615)
    > _A note on Kubernetes The Hard Way_: there are a few resources that you may find via an internet search that suggest you go through [*Kubernetes The Hard Way*](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) for CKAD. While this is an excellent learning exercise, it's not needed for CKAD. If you plan on taking CKA, then yes, allocate time to do it for CKA.

3. [What The Hack - Kubernetes By Example (Microsoft)](https://github.com/microsoft/WhatTheHack/blob/master/001-IntroToKubernetes) - Here, you'll get the chance to actually deploy a sample application. It uses Microsoft Cloud's [AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough).
